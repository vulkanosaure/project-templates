	// Place your snippets for TypeScript here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and 
	// description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the 
	// same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	"For loop": {
		"prefix": "for",
		"body": [
			"for(let ${1:i}=0;$1<$2;$1++){;",
			"\t$3",
			"}"
		],
		"description": "For loop"
	},
	
	"For in loop": {
		"prefix": "forin",
		"body": [
			"for(let ${1:k} in ${2:}){;",
			"\tlet ${3:item} = $2[$1];",
			"\t$4",
			"}"
		],
		"description": "For loop"
	}
